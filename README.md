Heatmiser Neo-Hub / Neostat / Neostat-e support for home-assistant.io

This is a work in progress for adding Heatmiser Neo-hub support to Home Assistant (https://home-assistant.io/).

It's a bit ugly and only handles one stat at present. When I've got my hands on some more I'll add support for these.
Only tested with a Heatmiser Neostat at present, Neostat-e support hopefully trivial and should be due in 2016.
Only reading and setting temperature supported at present.
There are glaringly obvious problems in the way the thermostats are read, I'll fix these in time.
